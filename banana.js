The runner was Patrick Wightman from the United Kingdom, who dressed as a banana.", "Bananas float in water, as do apples and watermelons.", "Hawaii is the only place in the U.S. where bananas are grown commercially, although at one time they were also grown in southern California and Florida. The overwhelming majority of the bananas Americans eat come from countries in Latin America and South America, including Costa Rica, Ecuador, Colombia, Honduras, Panama, and Guatemala.", "The type of banana you see in the supermarket is called a Cavendish banana.
